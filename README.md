<h3 class = "header">Why we started this</h3>

<p>We decided to start this project because one day, our cast were in the Kitchen cooking and hanging out, and then we started to talk a little bit, and we got this huge idea for this small channel that teaches people how to cook.</p>

<p>The idea seemed to work perfectly, especially since the group had a lighting stand and a camera. We were going to make Tacos for dinner and it seemed like the perfect opportunity. We spent hours recorded the scenes, and I'm not going to lie, the video turned out to be under 3 minutes! But, we had fun and thought we should do this more often. We've been editing and making Episode One ever since.</p>
